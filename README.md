This repository is a [ShowOff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) project for the talk I gave at the Grand Rapids Java User Group in May 2011.

[Ruby for desktop applications? Yes we can.](http://fletcherm.github.com/gr_jug_2011/#1)

If you weren't at the talk, then the slideshow may not make much sense. Too bad for you.
